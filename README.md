Just another experiment from me on data playground... hope it can become useful for others :) i'm using following tools to create the apps

1. d3.js - https://d3js.org/
2. crossfilter.js - http://square.github.io/crossfilter/
3. dc.js - https://dc-js.github.io/dc.js/
4. axios - https://github.com/mzabriskie/axios

#Important:
the docs folder only for demonstation purpose, basically the code is just the same with the master.
