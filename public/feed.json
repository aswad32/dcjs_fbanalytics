The news came two days after Khairuddin Abu Hassan, a former Malaysian ruling party official who has traveled the globe to highlight corruption allegations against Najib, was barred by police from boarding a plane in Kuala Lumpur bound for New York where he was to meet with FBI officials, Khairuddins lawyer Matthias Chang said. The appointment had reportedly been made with the help of the US Embassy in Kuala Lumpur. The scope of the FBI investigation is not clear yet, the report said. It is, however, the next in a row of other international investigations underway as the scandal surrounding 1MDB widens. Swiss authorities said this month they had frozen funds in Swiss banks amid investigations into 1MDB. Hong Kong authorities also said they were investigating a complaint related to the firm. In July, evidence from 1MDB investigations showed that nearly $700 million were transferred into the personal bank account of Najib, supposedly by a Middle Eastern donor. The money apparently flowed through Swiss banks. Later it also turned out that $2.4 billion of payments by 1MDB to its investment partner International Petroleum Investment Co, in Abu Dhabi apparently went missing. Najib denied any wrongdoing and said the allegations are a smear campaign against him and his ruling party. Indeed, a lot of the whistleblowing is attributed to Malaysias former prime minister and still influential figure Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who has been at the forefront of a year-long campaign to force Najib out of office. According to local bloggers, Khairuddins arrest on his way to the FBI in New York came shortly before he was to have left by a private jet belonging to a VVIP which was standing by fully-fueled at Subang airport. However, while Khairuddins lawyer Matthis Chiang is a long-time associate of Mahatir, it is not known that Mahatir actually owns a private jet. He has apparently used chartered or borrowed private jets from businessmen before, though.","fbid":"100003070896714","query_string":"1mdb","postid":"976368975808790"},{"_id":"57f67b7c8c74c163dcf31aa5","profile_name":"Smile So","created_time":"2016-10-06T16:04:46.000Z","message":"The real problem is the Attorney General of Switzerland was so stupid.

However, it cannot support anything which may be stacked against the Opposition or benefit the ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) at its expense. He charged the proposed reforms whitewash the RM53 billion 1MDB scandal and the RM4.2 billion donation controversy. It absolves BN from all responsibility for mega global financial scandals. Political funding reforms should not institutionalize money politics. For starters, he expects the Office of the Controller  over political donations and expenditure  with powers to confiscate donations to be used against opposition parties to cripple them financially. For too long, he pointed out, institutions have been compromised to benefit the BN. This includes the Election Commission (EC) as apparent from the on-going redelineation exercise. Guan Eng, who is also Penang Chief Minister, assured that his party does not oppose the National Consultative Committee on Political Financing (NCCPF) headed by Federal Minister Paul Low but political gimmicks was a different matter.The proposed reforms do not check money politics, he reiterated. He wants to know how Low can endorse an individual politician opening a personal bank account for political donations. No democratic country would sanction this. He argued that any political funding reforms must ensure that vested interests, the rich and criminal elements, cannot use money to buy influence. Whats even more shocking is the removal of the limits on election campaign expenditures, he said. In any case, the current limits on campaign spending by candidates of RM200,000 for a parliamentary seat and RM100,000 for state seats have been observed, more often than not, in the breach, he continued. Those limits have been abused by BN candidates 10 times over with impunity. The BN has abused its powers by not punishing the culprits. By allowing unlimited campaign spending, money politics will rule, making a complete mockery of elections, warned Guan Eng. There will no longer be free and fair elections but only bought elections. Also, he said, the failure to ensure full public declaration of assets by candidates was disappointing. Even worse was the failure to divorce politics from business. Political parties should not engage in commercial enterprises. BN component parties are actively engaged in business amounting to billions of ringgit, noted Guan Eng. This only benefits the personal interests of a few leaders.

Its chief executive officer Aireen Omar said the company felt that there is a lot of growth potential in Sarawak, besides wanting to assist the state in building its air connectivity. We are looking at many international routes as well as domestic routes and in order to facilitate this growth, we propose to have a dedicated low cost carrier terminal so that we can grow it exponentially, she told The Borneo Post after leading an Airasia delegation to meet Chief Minister Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Adenan Satem at Wisma Bapa Malaysia here yesterday. According to her, the routes that the company would be looking at were all those that the company had already established in its group networks, adding: Its just a matter of connecting those points in Asean, North Asia, India and Australia. Besides wanting to see Sarawak become one of the key regional hubs for the region, Aireen said AirAsia was also committed to seeing that its business in Sarawak grow not only through international connectivity but also intra-East Malaysia connectivity. So this is what we hope to do but right now with the current airport, it has reached its capacity and we are trying to find ways on how we can expand and build a dedicated low cost carrier terminal so that we can grow the business in Sarawak. When asked whether a location had been proposed for the LCCT, she said this was something that the state government was reviewing, without revealing the location. Aireen took the opportunity to thank Adenan and the state government for their support that had enabled the company to grow in Sarawak over the years.

Ahmad Syukri Yusuf, 22, was charged with statutory rape of the girl last year and faced up to 30 years in jail and whipping for the offence. But he later married the teenager  who is now 15  under Islamic law and the complaint was dropped. A court ruled in July there was no need to proceed with the case after Ahmad Syukri submitted a marriage certificate. His lawyer Azam Trudin said a court in Malaysias eastern state of Sarawak fixed the start of the re-trial for March 27 next year, adding that he would seek to have the decision for a retrial overturned. I will submit an application to withdraw the charge. The retrial will be repetitive (to what has been tried), Azam told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, adding that he was unsure whether there will be any new witnesses testifying. Ahmad Syukri and wife were both present in court during the proceeding, Azam said. Womens rights groups criticised the previous court ruling to drop the case, saying rape suspects should be barred from marrying their victims and child marriage should be banned. Under Malaysias civil laws, the legal minimum age for marriage is 18 but Muslim girls who are under 16 can obtain permission to marry from Islamic courts. Ethnic Malays, who are Muslim, make up about 60 per cent of the countrys population of 30 million. - See more at: http://m.themalaymailonline.com//retrial-for-man-charged-w Ahmad Syukri Yusuf, 22, was charged with statutory rape of the girl last year and faced up to 30 years in jail and whipping for the offence.

State govt to step in if FAS fails to get new chief October 7, 2016 By  Matthew Umpang KUCHING: The state government will intervene if the Football Association of Sarawak (FAS) fails to find a new president. Following its annual general meeting on Sept 17, FAS elected its new exco members but has yet to elect a president. Former FAS president Datu Sudarsono Osman, deputy president Datu Abu Bakar Marzuki and secretary-general Abdullah Julaihi all declined to be re-elected. Assistant Minister of Youth and Sports Datuk Abdul Karim Rahman Hamzah said yesterday the search for a new president must end as FAS cannot function without a leader. He added he understood the task of leading the most popular sports association in the state is difficult but there has got to be someone out there who could lead FAS. One of the reasons why no one want the post is the enormous budget needed to run the association. FAS run on a monthly estimated budget of RM1 million and I do understand that it wont be an easy task to find that amount. These are the things which deter many from taking over the post, he added. So far a number of candidates approached by FAS have declined the offer. Abdul Karim hoped that the national body, Football Association of Malaysia (FAM) would look into the problems faced Sarawak and Sabah in competing in the Malaysia league. While other teams will only have to travel by air twice a season, to play league matches, Sarawak have no choice to but to travel by air to Peninsular Malaysia (or Sabah) to play away matches. This incurs high cost for the team, he said. He said if Sarawak and Sabah continue to fork out their own money just to play away matches without the assistance of FAM, Sarawak could relook at the viability of playing in the Malaysia league. It is no wonder why no one dares to become FAS president for now. Whatever it is, for the good of Sarawak football, I hope that FAS will eventually find a president soon as no association can function properly without a leader, said Abdul Karim. He was speaking at a press conference for the coming National Sports Day (NSD 2016) celebration yesterday at the Sarawak Youth and Sports Department (JBS) Complex here.

The state government must give an explanation to the public in relation to the LMC issue that is sold to third party.

According to a portal, there are some houses rented at 850 per month and even sold at a staggering price of RM 348,000. We also notice luxury cars and motorcycle are parked at the apartment. This clearly shows low income earners are not staying there. If the vehicles not belong to the owners, who own them? asks Huan. Huan pointed out that according to press article released two years ago, Jagdeep had warned the property owners not rent out or sell their property to others. He also questioned the state government knowing this entire situation why the state government not taking a serious action or closing an eye. Ask I know, the owners are not allowed to sell or even rent out the property within 10 years. How come within 2 years the property is advertised? questions Huan.

'BN Johor loses two-thirds majority for first time with rep's exit' 7 Oct 2016 BN Johor has lost its two-thirds majority in the state assembly after the departure of Jorak assemblyperson Shahruddin Salleh from Umno. This will be the first time the Umno stronghold is governed without a two-thirds majority, said Johor Amanah chairperson Hassan. \"The composition of assemblypersons in the Johor state assembly has now changed following the statement from Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (Bersatu) president Muhyiddin Yassin yesterday about the appointment of Shahruddin as the party's secretary-general,\" he said in a statement today. He said since Shahruddin, the former Pagoh Umno vice chief, has joined Bersatu, the latter's party constitution stipulates that he automatically loses his old party membership. \"This means that assemblypersons from BN Johor has decreased from 38 to 37, while the opposition has increased from 18 to 19 assemblypersons in Johor,\" he said. The main implication is BN can no longer amend Johor's laws unilaterally. He predicted that even more Johor assemblypersons from Umno would leave the party before the dissolution of the state assembly. Meanwhile, he also welcomed Shahruddin to the opposition, saying he hopes they can work together to defeat the Umno/BN government in the upcoming general election.

Dewan-Bahasa-dan-PustakaKUALA LUMPUR: Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP) is trying to persuade the government to find the best mechanism to improve English language proficiency among school and university students, without compromising the status of Malay as the national language. DBP Board of Governors Chairman Prof Dr Md Salleh Yaapar said other than conduct an in-depth study to find the right mechanism, the government could seek the views of education experts. We will gradually persuade the ministers to look into this. If they are given a clear explanation and if there is sincerity, they must agree, he told reporters after the launching of DBP Innovation Day 2016 here yesterday. It was launched by Deputy Education Minister P Kamalanathan. Md Salleh was commenting on Sultan of Perak Sultan Nazrin Shahs call for a wise formula to create a bilingual society in efforts to develop human resources of a global nature without marginalising the national language. Earlier, Kamalanathan called on DBP to move forward creatively and constructively and find new ways to deliver its services and products, in line with the proliferation of information technology and communications. However, the adventure on innovation should not be individualistic, but implemented synergistically with partners from the public and private sectors. At the event, Kamalanathan also launched DBPNiaga.my, DBPs online sales system.

This morning we have filed a civil suit on behalf of our client Maria who is chairperson of Bersih against one Jamal Yunos. Maria is suing Jamal for defamation because of words that Jamal uttered at a press conference on two different occasions over the past week. In that press conference, he claimed that Bersih was infiltrated by IS and such things so this is clear defamation from our clients point of view, Surendran told reporters after filing the suit at the Kuala Lumpur High Court today. Since Maria is the chairperson of Bersih, and Bersih was accused of the allegations, Surendran said that constitutes as defamation on his client. Citing Jamals toilet bowl stunt, Surendran confirmed that Maria was also asking for aggravated damages. Jamal had tore up and flushed down the toilet Bersihs letter of demand for an apology and retraction. Bersih had earlier given Jamal a 48-hour notice to apoligise for his remarks but he instead flushed the letter of demand in front of journalists after calling it filth.

Yesterday, the OAG had issued a statement on its website saying it is lodging another request for Mutual Legal Assistance with the Malaysian Attorney-General's Chambers, for its investigations into alleged embezzlement and money laundering involving 1MDB.

This 66% external debt to GDP ratio has caused some concern to some people as Pakatan Whatevah often use this \"external debt\" thing to scare and confuse their weak-minded and knowledge-challenged supporters.  Let me explan. In line with IMF's new definition, External debt has been reclassified by BNM in 2014 to include for the first time, foreign deposits in Malaysia and foreign holding of ringgit debt by private companies and govt.  This new re-classification by BNM which made our external debt \"jump\" from RM200b to RM800b - but it also made this easier to compare with other countries to give us the true picture. As you can see from the list below, we are in no danger. Malaysia, being an open economy and a trade and investment dependent country will have high \"external debt\".  In fact, we are at 61 spot in terms of External Debt to GDP ratio. And these people always praise countries such as UK, Singapore and Hong Kong but cannot answer when asked why these countries' external debt to GDP ratio which are 569%, 408% and 334% respectively, have not gone bankrupt yet. So how come UK, Singapore and Hong Kong owed so much to non-residents? The answer is because they are major financial centers and business hubs. Foreign companies operating from there issue debt targeted at both local and foreign investors. That is to say, they borrow from both resident and non-resident investors to finance their operations and projects across the world. Furthermore, the large number of foreign banks lend to borrowers and accept accept wholesale, interbank or corporate deposits worldwide . Additionally, the major private banking and wealth management business gathered funds from rich individuals and families from the region, which are then deposited in banks or invested in various assets, most of them foreign. This explains why their total external debt is many times larger than their GDP as they are financing the other economies as well. Similarly, the financial system of Malaysia is well-developed and Malaysia wants to be an international financial hub too. This growth and the higher external debt ratio for Malaysia reflects these efforts to internationalize our financial system. Malaysia is in no danger of going bankrupt due to this \"high external debt\". The Govt itself only has 3% of total govt debt in foreign currency. Neither does Malaysia owe any money to World Bank and IMF. --- Read this from Singapore's own stats. http://www.singstat.gov.sg//data-di/national-summary-page Malaysia's exact same calculations are here: http://www.bnm.gov.my/index.php?ch=statistic_nsdp  (under section of gross external debt) You can also read it from here: https://en.wikipedia.org//List_of_countries_by_external_de In line with IMF's new definition, External debt has been reclassified by BNM in 2014 to include for the first time, foreign deposits in Malaysia and foreign holding of ringgit debt by private companies and govt.

Its chief executive officer Aireen Omar said the company felt that there is a lot of growth potential in Sarawak, besides wanting to assist the state in building its air connectivity. We are looking at many international routes as well as domestic routes and in order to facilitate this growth, we propose to have a dedicated low cost carrier terminal so that we can grow it exponentially, she told The Borneo Post after leading an Airasia delegation to meet Chief Minister Datuk Patinggi Tan Sri Adenan Satem at Wisma Bapa Malaysia here yesterday. According to her, the routes that the company would be looking at were all those that the company had already established in its group networks, adding: Its just a matter of connecting those points in Asean, North Asia, India and Australia. Besides wanting to see Sarawak become one of the key regional hubs for the region, Aireen said AirAsia was also committed to seeing that its business in Sarawak grow not only through international connectivity but also intra-East Malaysia connectivity. So this is what we hope to do but right now with the current airport, it has reached its capacity and we are trying to find ways on how we can expand and build a dedicated low cost carrier terminal so that we can grow the business in Sarawak. When asked whether a location had been proposed for the LCCT, she said this was something that the state government was reviewing, without revealing the location.

Menteri Muda Belia dan Sukan Datuk Abdul Karim Rahman Hamzah berkata, kekosongan jawatan itu perlu segera diisi untuk memastikan FAS dapat diterajui dengan baik. Memetik laporan Utusan Borneo, beliau menjelaskan, memegang jawatan tersebut merupakan tanggungjawab besar dan berat menyebabkan ada kalangan calon menolak. \"Bagaimanapun, kalau perkara ini tidak dapat diselesaikan, kemungkinan besar kerajaan negeri terpaksa berunding untuk mencari siapa yang patut diletak untuk menerajui FAS supaya ia dapat berjalan. \"Ini kerana kita tidak mahu membiarkan badan seperti itu hanya diterajui timbalan presiden sahajaia mesti ada presidennya,\" katanya.

FAS kini tanpa presiden selepas tiada calon yang berminat dengan jawatan itu dalam mesyuarat agung persatuan tersebut pada 17 September lalu ekoran pengunduran Datu Sudarsono Osman atas alasan mempunyai banyak komitmen lain. Sementara itu, beliau menegaskan kepada Persatuan Bolasepak Malaysia (FAM) agar membantu FAS dalam meringankan kos. Katanya, FAM patut melihat secara berlainan antara pasukan bola sepak Sarawak dan Sabah dengan Semenanjung atas faktor jarak kerana untuk bertanding, pasukan dari kedua-dua negeri ini perlu keluar dengan menggunakan kapal terbang. Keadaan itu menyebabkan kos pengendalian badan bola sepak kedua-dua negeri sangat tinggi. \"Kalau ada 14 negeri bertanding bermakna 13 kali pasukan Sarawak dan Sabah terpaksa terbang ke Semenanjung walhal negeri lain hanya perlu terbang dua kali sahaja iaitu ke Sarawak dan Sabah di mana selainya mereka hanya menggunakan bas. \"Sebab itulah kos untuk menguruskan FAS khususnya sangat mahal iaitu lebih sejuta sebulantakkan Sarawak sahaja perlu menanggung semua kos ini. \"Maka, FAM harus membantu FAS termasuk pasukan Sabah di mana kalau FAM tidak memberi perkiraan dalam hal ini, bagi saya kita perlu melihat semula kedudukan kita di dalam bola sepak Malaysia Memetik laporan Utusan Borneo, beliau menjelaskan, memegang jawatan tersebut merupakan tanggungjawab besar dan berat menyebabkan ada kalangan calon menolak. \"Bagaimanapun, kalau perkara ini tidak dapat diselesaikan, kemungkinan besar kerajaan negeri terpaksa berunding untuk mencari siapa yang patut diletak untuk menerajui FAS supaya ia dapat berjalan. \"Ini kerana kita tidak mahu membiarkan badan seperti itu hanya diterajui timbalan presiden sahajaia mesti ada presidennya,\" katanya.

Quote: KOTA KINABALU  Sabah Deputy Chief Minister Tan Sri Joseph Pairin Kitingan said today he is sad that two of his top officers were implicated in the one of the countrys largest ever corruption busts. Pairin who is also state infrastructure development minister said he had learnt from newspaper reports that the duo held by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) in the high-profile RM3.3 billion graft investigation are from the Sabah Water Department. It is sad to read in the newspapers and to know that two of my top officers have been taken in by the MACC for questioning recently, he said in a statement. He added that he has yet to receive any official report on their arrests. My permanent secretary and also the state secretary have advised me to wait for an official report or await for future developments to take place before certain procedures will have to be activated. In the meantime, we can be comforted by the law which states that a person is presumed innocent until proven otherwise, he added. Pairin also said he hoped the two officers can explain themselves properly to the MACC so they can return to work peacefully after the investigations end. The MACC recently arrested two senior officials of an unnamed state agency for alleged corruption. The national graft fighters have since held a news conference here where they announced and displayed a whopping haul of RM114 million worth in cash, jewellery, land grants and branded goods that they said had been seized from the duos properties, bank accounts and safety deposit boxes held by them and their family from around the state capital city. The total wealth amassed is expected to grow as the MACC enlist professional pawnbrokers to evaluate the value of the items seized later today. Four people are currently under remand pending the completion of investigations, upon which they may be charged. They are the state department director, 54, his 51-year-old deputy and 55-year-old businessman brother who carries the Datuk title, and his accountant, 50.

The national graft fighters have since held a news conference here where they announced and displayed a whopping haul of RM114 million worth in cash, jewellery, land grants and branded goods that they said had been seized from the duos properties, bank accounts and safety deposit boxes held by them and their family from around the state capital city. The total wealth amassed is expected to grow as the MACC enlist professional pawnbrokers to evaluate the value of the items seized later today. Four people are currently under remand pending the completion of investigations, upon which they may be charged. They are the state department director, 54, his 51-year-old deputy and 55-year-old businessman brother who carries the Datuk title, and his accountant, 50.

Drive to the nearest busy area or polis station 3. Drive through a security drop barrier as it is made of light aluminium material.  4. Stay locked in your car and keep driving and honking non stop 5. Tint your car Windscreen to 6MIL strength, it takes a long time to break and will shoo away the robber.

The fact remains that when Najib took over as PM, the Ringgit was at USD1 = RM3.73 - a drop of only 12% and is at RM4.10.  Despite currency rising and falling and despite our recent Ringgit weakness is due to global oil prices and a strengthening USD, PakaTun says this drop in Ringgit is a sign of Malaysia going bankrupt.

The party is inviting the public to join them on Oct 12, to show support for the jailed politician. The gathering is in conjunction with the judicial review application Anwar filed against his Sodomy II conviction, which was upheld by the Federal Court in February last year. PKR vice-president Tian Chua said besides showing support to Anwar, the gathering will also send a message that the people want change. \"It's not only about Anwar, it's about defending a system, demanding change in the system. \"If we want to see change, the people rising can show our stand, and our demands for reform,\" Tian said today. Anwar is currently serving a five-year jail sentence after he was convicted of sodomising his former aide Saiful Bukhari Azlan. He has maintained his innocence, saying that the Sodomy II charge was politically motivated. In 2000, Anwar was previously also convicted of sodomising his former speechwriter Munawar Anees, and adoptive brother Sukma Darmawan Sasmita Atmadja in 1998. The earlier conviction overturned by the Federal Court in 2004. The judicial review will be the last legal avenue for Anwar to get his Sodomy II conviction overturned. Speaking during a press conference at the PKR headquarters in Petaling Jaya, the Batu MP said the gathering will be a peaceful one. \"We are just going to turn up to show support, not to create trouble,\" he said, adding that they will inform the police about the rally. He said party state leaders have been instructed to mobilise their members for the gathering, with the main bulk expected to come from Kuala Lumpur and Selangor.

Namun orang UMNONOK makin panas dengan kebenaran yang saya ni hot chick yang bijak Ya lah Bukan saya yang berumur senja berzina dengan jantan lain dan di ceraikan sebab tu. Kalau saya kat umur macam tu, saya dah mula ingat pekara baik-baik, ingat kubur panggil dah. Ni perangai orang UMNONOK mana boleh lari dari maksiat. Ya lah, mana tak panas, dulu dia kata saya sunyi tak ada suami anak, rupanya dia yang tak ada anak dan janda kena cerai sebab kantoi maksiat dengan jantan lain tapi mengaku anak angkat tu anak dia. Sengaja pula saya rahsiakan status saya sebab nak menganjing dia. Suka tengok dia hina fitnah saya meroyan-royan, saya gelak je sambil makan pop corn tengok terlatah dia. Saya bukan suka canang di wall kisah keluarga. Lagi pun saya tak minat post pic cium anak angkat konon tunjuk kasih sayang, padahal zalim pada anak tu. Takat bin, panggil lawywr pun boleh bin sesiapa pun walau pun ber bin kan Obama. So kalau hidup dia tak bahagia atau sunyi, jangan jeles kat orang lain. Cuba tinggalkan sikit maksiat tu, latest pun kawan dia juga yang cerita dia dengan atok tua kaki edit macam budak tadika sebilik dengan nenek masa PRU lepas kat Dynasty. Buat apa masa tu? Mengaji ke?  Well sebelum nak fitnah orang, tengok diri sendiri dah akhlak anda tu. Jangan bercerita bab agama dan rumahtangga orang kalau diri sendiri 100 kali teruk dari orang yang di fitnah tu. Saya tak balas sebab Tuhan dah balas sebelum saya bertindak, buktinya?

He is claiming that many times, renovation work on prewar buildings had been carried out without permits. Citing an example. George Town Heritage Action co-founder Mark Lay pointed out that a prewar building housing a coffee shop in Penang Road was renovated with cement and modern materials without a permit. He said that prior to Sept 1, SAP rules were not enforceable as the SAP was still in draft form. So what we are now focusing on is the post Sept 1 period and we want to know if the council and the state are serious about enforcing this document or whether it is just for show, he said. The SAP for the George Town World Heritage Site was gazetted on Sept 1. On the coffee shop, Lay said he was informed that the coffee shops permit was just for improving the piping system and electrical wiring but illegal renovations on the floors and walls were carried out. After we alerted the council, it issued the coffee shop with a stop-work order on Sept 27. The workers and contractors stopped work that afternoon but a few days later, they were back at work, he said. The cafe was closed when Lay went to check on it yesterday. He then took reporters to a heritage shophouse in Jalan Cheong Fatt Tze and another in Penang Road. A check at the shophouse in Jalan Cheong Fatt Tze showed that the floor tiles, which Lay said dated back to the 1920s, were hacked up. Hacking up the original tiles is actually causing the unit to lose value and at the same time, it is illegal. What we need is an effective monitoring taskforce. The enforcement must be more proactive than reactive, he said. Meanwhile, at the shophouse in Penang Road, Lay claimed the owners had removed the wooden shutters and replaced them with glass. He said they also removed the shops metal grille and replace it with a roller door. After we complained to the council, it sent a letter telling the owners to fix back the shutters and grille but nothing has been done. MBPP councillor Felix Ooi, who is the planning and development alternate chairman, said the council was aware of all these cases. Notices have been given to the said premises and action has been taken on one of the cases. The property owners should have no excuse for not knowing the planning guidelines. Information can be obtained at MBPP in Komtar and the George Town World Heritage Incorporated office in Lebuh Acheh, he said.

Will he blackmail me; 4. Will he sell off my secrets and a hundred other reasons asking me to be cautious. So if you ask me, I will say,  it's easier for me to trust a doctor than a lawyer esp a political lawyer like NAZRI who twists and turns black into white and white into black like a witch.","fbid":"100012220350721","query_string":"mahathir","postid":"221006038316740"},{"_id":"57f756dd8c74c13ab0d421fa","profile_name":"Subki Shaari","created_time":"2016-10-07T07:55:35.000Z","message":"Mai sapa nk Join..!!

Malaysias government said late yesterday Mugabe will have a meeting with Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak but otherwise gave scant details on the purpose of the rare visit or the reason for the last-minute notification. The foreign ministry said it was the Zimbabwean presidents first working visit to Malaysia since 2000, but he has previously visited Malaysia and Singapore for medical procedures. Mugabes health has been increasingly under the spotlight in recent years. He has denied reports of ill health and vowed to stand for re-election in 2018, but this year has seen demonstrations against his rule, which stretches back to Zimbabwes independence in 1980. Mugabe and former Malaysian prime minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad, who stepped down in 2003, shared a close relationship and a love of anti-Western rhetoric in defence of the developing world. A Malaysian foreign ministry spokesman said there would be no public events or media access during Mugabes visit.","fbid":"508225072706069","query_string":"mahathir","postid":"538310783030831"},{"_id":"57f773078c74c14cd4510150","profile_name":"Bapak Long Junus","created_time":"2016-10-07T09:47:02.000Z","message":"Kalau Dr Mahathir buat ja benda ni, memang dia kena bunuh.

Speaking to FMT, Zaid said the voice of the people had significance and could not be ignored. The Citizens Declaration shows that people are united about what they want. It shows that there are people in this country, like Dr Mahathir, who are willing to carry that message. It shows that people are willing to stand up for certain issues, but there are forces in the country that do not want to support it, and what can we do? He claimed the country was divided into people who wanted change and people who preferred the status quo, but this difference in opinion was a good thing. We see that there are people for change and there are people who dont want change, and I think that is very important because can you imagine if there was only one voice? Only one system? People can do whatever they want and it would be disastrous. At least now people will understand that you cannot control other forces in the country. Zaid praised former Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad for sticking to his word that he would hand over to the King the signatures of those who supported the Declaration. It was not a waste. Dr Mahathir has been very frank with the people of this country and he promised them that he would deliver to the King the message, but he cannot control what the King decides. He tried his best and thats how we should see it. Two days ago, Dr Mahathir admitted that he had failed to convince the King on the Citizens Declaration during an audience with him recently. Speaking at a press conference, his first following the meeting at the Istana Anak Bukit in Kedah last month, Dr Mahathir said he spoke to the King on the demands made by the Citizens Declaration, which carried more than 1.4 million signatures, but could not get a positive answer. The Citizens Declaration campaign, launched by Dr Mahathir and 40 others in March, calls for Malaysians to join in the quest to remove Najib via peaceful means. The document, which was made available online and on hard copy, also sought institutional reforms and the repeal of laws that violated fundamental human rights. The document, and the movement which initiated it, has largely been dismissed by Barisan Nasional leaders as a futile effort to topple a democratically-elected governmen People can do whatever they want and it would be disastrous.

What failed Policy since 1957.  Since Abdullah Badawis government did not have an economic team both he and MO1 relied on Nor Mohd Yakcop. Since the government relied on economic growth (for the sake of showing some growth figures) he gave them growth. And as revenues were insufficient he just borrowed money. When Badawi left, the debt had increased to RM250 billion. Now under Najib debt is actually RM800 billion and not RM600 billion. (They have removed RM200 billion of housing loans to achieve this figure). They are just playing with figures. The World Bank said that we can rely on consumption. What happened? Our household debt is now among the highest in the world. It is definitely the highest in Asia. Malaysia hutang No.1 !! 1Malaysia Hutang !! And with retrenchment, unemployment and prices of essentials going up and banks now not lending to people and instead banks recalling loans, how are the people going to consume? Then they have implemented the GST which has stressed the peoples purchasing capacity further. So the consumption driven growth model is failing even more. The only way to help the people and stimulate growth now is to reduce taxes all across the board which have a direct impact on the consumers purchasing power ie reduce income taxes, abolish or reduce the GST, reduce car import duties and reduce other direct and indirect taxes on motor vehicles and reduce workers EPF contributions until the economy improves. But the govts finances are just rotting to hell. They are cutting allocations all across the board. The tax boys have been instructed to arbitrarily assess companies taxes. The govt is desperate for money. The best solution now is for MOF and also MO1 to resign as he has no idea how to manage the economy. Calling Nor Mohd Yakcop again for advise will not make any better those things which they have already made so worse over these past years. The economy and the country did not become so bad overnite. It takes years of incompetence and mismanagement to create so much havoc in the economy. Maybe MO1 and Jho Low can try and start another 1MDB and see whether with a Paid Up Capital of say RM2 million, they can borrow even RM10.00 (TEN Ringgit) from the international bankers? MO1s Treasury Bills are now zero rated. MO1 can show us how he and Jho Low can borrow from the international markets? Page 1 of The Star reported that RM114 million corruption. Why did MACC go and arrest them? Maybe it was just a donation? Maybe they learnt from MO1, Cowgate and many others. If the AG says no case against MO1 and if the AG also withdrew charges against the Cowgate despite the Federal Court ruling that the Cowgate case must go on then why should MACC go and arrest those two fellows?

Speaking to FMT, Zaid said the voice of the people had significance and could not be ignored. The Citizens Declaration shows that people are united about what they want. It shows that there are people in this country, like Dr Mahathir, who are willing to carry that message. It shows that people are willing to stand up for certain issues, but there are forces in the country that do not want to support it, and what can we do? He claimed the country was divided into people who wanted change and people who preferred the status quo, but this difference in opinion was a good thing. We see that there are people for change and there are people who dont want change, and I think that is very important because can you imagine if there was only one voice? Only one system? People can do whatever they want and it would be disastrous. At least now people will understand that you cannot control other forces in the country. Zaid praised former Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad for sticking to his word that he would hand over to the King the signatures of those who supported the Declaration. It was not a waste. Dr Mahathir has been very frank with the people of this country and he promised them that he would deliver to the King the message, but he cannot control what the King decides.

Dia yang cuba membuat permohonan dua kali iaitu pada 2013 dan 2015 tetapi hanya sia-sia sahaja sehingga menyebabkan gadis itu berada dalam situasi itu kini. Ketika ditemui di pekarangan Bangunan Tuanku Haji Bujang di sini semalam, Herline yang dilahirkan pada 31 Ogos 1999 berkata, dia tiada pilihan selain terpaksa meninggalkan sekolahnya, iaitu SMK Tebakang di Serian kerana tidak mempunyai MyKad setiap kali diminta pihak sekolah berbuat demikian. Berasal dari Kampung Mongkos di Tebakang, Herline ditemani bapanya Ji-in Ngampu. Menurut Ji-in yang isterinya warga Indonesia, dua anak lagi anak mereka mempunyai MyKad, berbeza dengan Herline yang merupakan anak sulungnya. Kehadiran mereka di pekarangan bangunan berkenaan diketuai kumpulan daripada S4S dan Persatuan Dayak Iban Sarawak (SADIA), semalam yang mengadakan demonstrasi aman kepada Jabatan Pendaftaran Negara (JPN), bagi menjelaskan kepada jabatan tentang kesengsaraan dihadapi kanak-kanak di seluruh negeri, yang menjejaskan komuniti luar bandar. Aktivis hak asasi manusia Peter John Jaban ketika ditemui pemberita berkata gadis itu dinafikan kad pengenalan walaupun bapanya warga Sarawak. Ibu bapanya berkahwin mengikut adat Bidayuh pada tahun 1998 sebelum dia (Herline) dilahirkan dan mempunyai sijil lahir sebagai bukti, katanya sambil memberitahu bahawa pasangan itu mempunyai sijil perkahwinan sivil. John menjelaskan, JPN telah mengeluarkan sijil lahir kepada Herline yang menunjukkan dia adalah warganegara Malaysia dengan nombor MyKad. John percaya terdapat beberapa kes yang sama dalam kalangan masyarakat luar bandar. Sementara itu dalam kenyataan yang diedarkan kepada media semalam, John menyatakan SADIA dan S4S kini dalam usaha membantu dengan membawa perkara itu melalui tindakan undang-undang terhadap JPN. Kes berkenaan di bawah peguam bela Simon Siah, Chua dan Chow untuk mendapatkan keputusan agar JPN mesti mengiktiraf perhubungan keluarga yang ditadbir oleh adat. Sementara itu Siah berpendapat, adat mempunyai kuasa undang-undang di Sabah dan Sarawak, Namun JPN tidak menegakkan kedua-duanya kerana kejahilan di Putrajaya atau kerana dasar untuk memadamkan adat, tetapi kita tidak pasti. Hasilnya, kita melihat banyak kes di mana penduduk luar bandar Sarawak tidak dapat mendaftar anak mereka hanya kerana mereka mengikut adat mereka yang sekian lama wujud, sedangkan ia adalah hak mereka di bawah undang-undang Malaysia dan undang-undang antarabangsa, katanya.

The DAP federal lawmaker claimed that the BN lost its two-thirds majority in the southern state after its Jorak assemblyman Datuk Shahruddin Salleh quit Umno for Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia (PPBM). Shahruddins defection would mean the Opposition parties have a combined representation of 19 out of 56 seats in the Johor legislative assembly. To form the Johor state government, a realigned opposition would need another 10 seats, i.e. 29 seats, the Johor DAP chief said in a statement. Yesterday, Pagoh MP Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin announced the appointment of Shahruddin as PPBM secretary-general. However, it is unknown if Shahruddin has resigned from Umno. Calls to his phone were unanswered, The Star Online reported today. The news portal also reported Shahruddin is expected to turn up at a gathering in Bukit Pasir in Muar tonight, which will also feature Muhyiddin and Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad as PPBM pro-tem president and chairman respectively. Shahruddin reportedly left his position as Pagoh Umno division vice-chairman in July. It is learnt that he relinquished his position to show his dissatisfaction over the partys move to sack Muhyiddin as Umno deputy president.

Bekas timbalan perdana menteri yang dipecat oleh Perdana Menteri Datuk Seri Najib Razak itu juga dilaporkan berkata beliau telah memberi nasihatnya tetapi tidak diendahkan. \"Sebelum Najib pecat Mukhriz saya hantar mesej kepada beliau saya beritahu 'amaran baik' jangan buat begituitu permulaan kepada kejatuhan BN, tapi yang pasti mereka tidak endahkan, jadi perkiraan saya BN di Kedah sudah cukup ranum dan cukup matang untuk terjatuh,\" katanya. Mukhriz dipecat daripada Umno pada Jun lalu, dan disingkirkan sebagai menteri besar Kedah meskipun di sebalik kejayaannya merampas negeri jelapang padi itu daripada PAS pada tahun 2013. Ketika itu, BN berjaya mendapatkan 21 kerusi berbanding 15 yang dimenangi oleh Pakatan Rakyat. Tahap kesihatan Ahmad Bashah sentiasa menjadi persoalan apabila beliau dilaporkan pitam ketika menghadiri mesyuarat pada 4 Jun lalu dan sering mendapat rawatan susulan. Bagi ramai pemerhati politik, Mukhriz adalah mangsa akibat perang mulut antara bapanya, dan Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad dan Najib. Namun Umno Kedah mendakwa Mukhriz gagal menyatupadukan parti dan tidak mempunyai strategi membangunkan negeri itu. Mahathir, yang pada satu masa menyokong Najib, kini telah menjadi pengkritiknya paling sengit, terutama selepas dakwaan penglibatan Najib dalam skandal 1MDB dan sumbangan RM2.6 bilion daripada keluarga diraja Arab Saudi yang dimasukkan ke akaun bank peribadinya sebelum PRU13.

Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe's health has been increasingly under the spotlight in recent years Malaysia's government said late Thursday Mugabe will have a meeting with Prime Minister Najib Razak but otherwise gave scant details on the purpose of the rare visit or the reason for the last-minute notification. The foreign ministry said it was the Zimbabwean president's first working visit to Malaysia since 2000, but he has previously visited Malaysia and Singapore for medical procedures. Mugabe's health has been increasingly under the spotlight in recent years. He has denied reports of ill health and vowed to stand for reelection in 2018, but this year has seen demonstrations against his rule, which stretches back to Zimbabwe's independence in 1980. Mugabe and former Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad, who stepped down in 2003, shared a close relationship and a love of anti-Western rhetoric in defence of the developing world. A Malaysian foreign ministry spokesman said there would be no public events or media access during Mugabe's visit.","fbid":"1534564533470800","query_string":"mahathir","postid":"1744884465772138"},{"_id":"57f79c248c74c13c9c7fbba9","profile_name":"Malaysian Monkey","created_time":"2016-10-07T10:22:30.000Z","message":"#MALAYSIA #COMEDY_COURT  LOL ","fbid":"583688868386386","query_string":"mahathir","postid":"1142067865881814"},{"_id":"57f79c288c74c13c9c7fbbaa","profile_name":"Raja Petra Kamarudin","created_time":"2016-10-07T11:19:51.000Z","message":"Mahathirs false flag operation Mahathir is trying to give the impression that none of his trustees, proxies, nominees and cronies are abandoning him.

And what would happen to Malaysia-US ties? On the first matter, outgoing US ambassador to Malaysia Joseph Y Yun, in an interview with Malaysiakini at his office in Kuala Lumpur, was initially reluctant to share his views.

Wow. Good luck, you know? he chuckled. No, nothing. But on a more serious note, Yun stressed there was a reason only four people  Riza Aziz, Jho Low, Khadem al-Qubaisi and Mohamed Ahmed Badawy Al-Husseiny  were named in the DOJ lawsuit to seize assets related to 1MDB. The four people named in the filing are because they own the assets in the US. That is why they were named, he explained. Yun said he suspected a civil hearing would take place soon, but maintained that it was not political and would not affect ties between Malaysia and the US. Ive not seen any effect on our relations and I think the case would be isolated, that it would continue on its own track. While our bilateral relations  the way we work, the way our governments work on diplomacy, on business, on investment  wont be affected, he said.

Asked why it was not a criminal case, Yun said he was in the dark about this, as it was the DOJs decision.

So, it is in our interest to protect our own economic business and financial system. The DOJ action is so far a civil case.

The suit was filed on her behalf  by lawyers N Surendran and Melissa Sasidaran, as Chin is presently away in Kedah launching a Bersih event. Chin said the statements were completely false, malicious and calculated to injure her reputation in the eyes of the public. His statements have confused the public and caused uneasiness among them, she said in the court papers filed by the legal firm Daim & Gamany. Chin said Jamal knew his inflammatory statements would be widely published by the media. The coalition of electoral reform group leader is also seeking an unspecified amount of damages and other relief deemed fit by the court. On Tuesday, she sent a letter of demand (LoD) , asking Jamal to apologise over his claim that the electoral watchdog has been infiltrated by terrorist group Islamic State (IS). However, an adamant Jamal said he would not apologise to her and then proceeded to tear up the LoD and flush it down the toilet. Stressing that he stood by his sources claims, the Red Shirts movement leader also promised that the movement would keep attacking the electoral reform group, perhaps more aggressively. On Sept 28, Jamal, claimed that Bersih 2.0 had planned to take over several strategic locations (during the Bersih 5 rally on Nov 19), such as airports, like what happened during protests in Thailand. On Oct 4, Jamal was said to have uttered defamatory words against Chin by implying that her movement was influenced by IS and Daesh elements when he made a report at the Bukit Aman Federal police headquarters. Bersih 2.0 last week started its convoy simultaneously in Kota Bharu, Lumut, Arau, Johor Bahru, Sandakan and Miri in the run-up to its gathering in Kuala Lumpur on Nov 19.

Quote: PETALING JAYA: Foreign Minister Anifah Aman today rubbished allegations that a top official in the Sabah Water Department detained in one of the biggest corruption cases in the country is the Kimanis Umno treasurer. Anifah, who is the divisions chief, also denied any involvement in the case, arguing that as the foreign minister there was nothing he could offer to anyone. Neither did he control the funds for the water department in Sabah. It is best to know where the funds are coming from and who has the power to approve them. So my fellow Sabahans, I can proudly say to you that not only am I not involved but I did not know these funds or projects existed, he said in a short statement. The Kimanis lawmaker was responding to allegations that have been swirling around social media that the top official had links to Umno. Among those who made the allegation included former Gopeng Umno Wanita Chief Hamidah Osman. She has since deleted her blogpost on the matter. Blogger Lim Sian See, in a Facebook post, revealed that the Kimanis Umno tresurer was in fact Rizal @ Raymond Godfrey Abdullah. Anifah went on to say that he would take legal action against those who attempted to defame him as he did not want the public to think that Malaysias foreign minister was corrupt. And more importantly to clear my name. On Wednesday, cash and assets worth RM114.5 million were seized by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission following the arrest of four men in Sabah. The four men, including two Sabah Water Department senior officers, are being investigated for allegedly receiving kickbacks from federal projects in Sabah. The projects are said to be worth up to RM3.3 billion.

A source in the ongoing investigation disclosed that evaluators from Bank Rakyat were called in to evaluate the collection of gold and gemstone jewellery earlier today and took just under two hours to come up with the evaluation.

MACC deputy chief commissioner (operations) Datuk Azam Baki confirmed the amount. The jewellery was found in the homes and safe deposit boxes of the top two State Water Department officials. It adds to a staggering amount of wealth that has so far included over RM53 million in cash found stashed in the homes, offices and cars owned by the duo. Their other belongings seized include nine luxury cars, 94 branded handbags, branded watches, at least 127 land grants around Sabah and more than RM60 million in bank accounts. Yet to be included is the value of the watches, nine luxury vehicles and the land grants. They are also looking into overseas bank accounts, and the final tally is expected to exceed RM200 million.

The Kimanis lawmaker was responding to allegations that have been swirling around social media that the top official had links to Umno. Among those who made the allegation included former Gopeng Umno Wanita Chief Hamidah Osman. She has since deleted her blogpost on the matter. Blogger Lim Sian See, in a Facebook post, revealed that the Kimanis Umno tresurer was in fact Rizal @ Raymond Godfrey Abdullah. Anifah went on to say that he would take legal action against those who attempted to defame him as he did not want the public to think that Malaysias foreign minister was corrupt. And more importantly to clear my name. On Wednesday, cash and assets worth RM114.5 million were seized by the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission following the arrest of four men in Sabah. The four men, including two Sabah Water Department senior officers, are being investigated for allegedly receiving kickbacks from federal projects in Sabah. The projects are said to be worth up to RM3.3 billion. Anifah, who is the divisions chief, also denied any involvement in the case, arguing that as the foreign minister there was nothing he could offer to anyone.

Its director of strategic programme development, Norazam Samah, advised donors to make sure the organisations they are donating to give specific projects they were working on. You should not donate to an organisation that gives a general cause, for instance just Gaza relief. It must be able to give you the name of the project, like it is helping to build 500 homes in a particular village. It has to be specific and how much they need from the public to support them. The donor can wait for a few months and ask how all the money donated was used, she said. Another tip is for the organisation to stick to its mandate. If the organisations mandate is education and they go to different countries and carry out medical work, clearly something is not right there because they dont have the expertise to do that, she told FMT. For example, Norazam said Mercy Malaysias mandate was to do medical work. Due to that, it carries out medical work overseas. Islamic Relief Malaysia, an international relief and development charity organisation, said people should study the organisations annual reports before donating to charitable bodies. Its head of services, Sharlina Adnan, said: We believe if people want to donate towards humanitarian aid, they should do some research on the website. Check the annual reports to know if it is genuine, she told FMT. Islamic Relief Malaysia is part of the international body based in Birmingham, UK. Sharlina said the relief group, with 45 branches worldwide, provided humanitarian aid during natural disasters. We focus on helping the poor. On Thursday, DSP Foo Wei Min, who is with the Commercial Crime Department, had told a terrorism financing forum here that police believed a lot of Malaysians were donating money to overseas charitable causes, but the money was actually being used to fund terrorist activities all over the world. This was done through websites pleading for donations to help poor Muslim families or to support the Palestinian cause, he warned. This was easily done as the Internets relative anonymity allowed terrorist groups to solicit online donations from both supporters and unsuspecting donors of charitable activities. Malaysian Social Research Executive Director Lia Syed said an organisations website should have its work listed on it for all donors to see. It should have all the member details and annual reports. If these details are not there, people should check with Registrar of Societies (RoS) or other places to know if they are legitimate. She said the details of the work listed on the website will show if the organisation practised transparency in its activities and to prove to sponsors that it was genuine.

In adverts for Indian TV channels, newspapers and billboards, the now bearded Brosnan cut a familiar pose as he grappled with villains, flirted with beautiful women and took a spin in a high-end sports car. But instead of concealing a Walter PKK within his immaculately-tailored tuxedo, Brosnan was revealed to be carrying a can of pan masala  a mixture of betel nut and spices that leaves lurid red stains on the mouth after being chewed or when it is spat out. Class never goes out of style, the 63-year-old Irish actor says at end of the commercial for the Pan Bahar brand. The new ad triggered a flurry of jokes, sarcastic comments and photoshopped images of Brosnan on social media, with his lips stained red or his head superimposed onto the torso of a tobacconist clad in a grubby singlet. How desperate is #PierceBrosnan for money, wrote one Twitter user, Aseem Chhabra. Pan masala is mixture of areca nut, pastes, spices and sometimes tobacco meant to refresh palates and aid digestion, but the makers of Pan Bahar say their product is free of nicotine.

Today, I myself am even closer to the departures hall than arrivals, so to speak, and my thoughts turn to how I would like to be treated when the time comes, Tutu wrote in an op-ed published in The Washington Post. I have prepared for my death and have made it clear that I do not wish to be kept alive at all costs, said Tutu, who was discharged from hospital late last month. I hope I am treated with compassion and allowed to pass on to the next phase of lifes journey in the manner of my choice, he wrote. Tutu, who is fondly referred to as the Arch, has spent time in hospital on several occasions since last year for a nagging infection. One reason for his hospitalisation has been an infection resulting from the prostate cancer treatment he has been receiving for nearly 20 years. Now more than ever, I feel compelled to lend my voice to this cause, he said. For those suffering unbearably and coming to the end of their lives, merely knowing that an assisted death is open to them can provide immeasurable comfort. Medically-assisted suicide or voluntary euthanasia is illegal in South Africa, but in recent years there have been growing calls for it to be legalised.  National treasure  Early on Friday, Tutu presided over eucharist at his home church in Cape Town, an AFP photographer witnessed. He paid a moving tribute to St Georges Cathedral before laying his head on the communion table and briefly wept. I have indicated that when the time comes I would like to rest here, permanently, with you, he told the worshippers. Tutu, who became the first black Anglican archbishop of Cape Town in 1986, had a cup of tea with worshippers after the Friday morning service. President Jacob Zuma and the last apartheid leader F.W. de Klerk led tributes to Tutu. In a statement Zuma said Tutu has contributed immensely to the freedom and democratic dispensation of South Africa. He continues to inspire the nation and the world in the promotion of human rights, justice and the wellbeing of all especially the poor, said Zuma. De Klerk and his foundation wished Tutu the best of health in the year ahead, and acknowledged his valuable role as a peacemaker, as well as his contribution towards goodwill between all South Africans, and towards South Africas constitutional democracy. Ordained at the age of 30 and appointed archbishop in 1986, Tutu used his position to advocate for international sanctions against white-minority rule in South Africa, and later to lobby for rights globally. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984.

He said he had noticed a trend in such politically-motivated reports. On another matter, the IGP told the news portal that both Bersih and the Red Shirts movement will be investigated for their failure to notify the police on their gatherings. Be it the yellow or the red, they have violated the law. They should notify us before organising any event. There was one party that did not notify us, but expects protection from us. Asked about the report lodged by Red Shirts leader Jamal Md Yunos that Bersih had links with the Islamic State, Khalid said police were investigating the truth of the matter. Bersih has denied the allegation and its chairperson, Maria Chin Abdullah, has filed a defamation suit against Jamal. When a police report has been lodged, we have to investigate. With or without reports lodged, he said, the police would act against those who broke the law.
